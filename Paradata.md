For Module 4 I chose to build a hologram projector to bring my 3D model from module 1 into the physical world. As you can tell from my process notes, this was not an easy endeavour. I wanted to make this because simply 3D printing the model would have been easy and it would require only a little effort to achieve. I wanted to see if I could get it to work like in the video. It didn't end up working, but the process was fun and satisfying. I also hadn't done anything crafty in university and writing essays killed my creativity a little bit. I t felt good to build something and put my own spin on it. 

"The augmented reality revolution is, for now, being led by the technology and by big corporations." (Eve, 2015) I believe this statement applies to more than just augmented reality and that it is untrue. The revolution is being led by all the small creators who want to create better things or improve on existing technology to get more out of the experience. There wouldn't be a Dead Man's Nose without Eve himself because while the big companies focus on making technology that can be mass produced and easily sold, the little guys are on the front lines paving the roads with their innovative ideas that don't need to be approved by hundreds of people. All it takes is for one person to want to see what they are capable of and how far they can push the technology they have access to.
