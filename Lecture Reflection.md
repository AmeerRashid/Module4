The last two classes we had were probably some of the more interesting ones of the year, not only because of the doughnuts, but because of the chance we got to look back and think about what we learned throughout the semester. We have been completing modules over the past few months, but it is hard to recognize what we have learned until we sat down together and wrote it out. 

It also allows us to learn from our classmates one last time because over the three years I have been at Carleton, I have not needed anyone's help until this class. Partly because it was challenging, but also because everyone was trying different things and it allows us to eliminate some of that invisible labour before wasting our time because we learned from the experience of someone else. The entry tickets were also a nice way to get everyone talking to one another because after discussing what we had written we ask each other how the module is going and we exchange some ideas and advice.

This is definitely one of the more valuable classes I've taken in my university career. It made me more confident with creating on a computer and it has given me perspective which will help me with school and, more importantly, the real world.
